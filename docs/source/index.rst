NWB for Python
=================================

PyNWB is a Python package for working with NWB files.

Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N) is a project to develop a
unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, focused on the
dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental
conditions. The NWB:N team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward
breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience.
